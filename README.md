## Description

This repository contains implementations of two image processing techniques:

1. **Image Completion Model (Lmser-pix2seq)**: A method for learning stable sketch representations for sketch healing. For more details, refer to the following publication:

2. **RDP algorithm** : This technique utilizes the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm for stroke simplification.
